# Predicting Flight Delays

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight delays using advanced machine learning techniques. As air travel continues to grow, flight delays cause significant inconvenience to passengers and operational challenges for airlines. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, this project provides insights and accurate delay predictions to mitigate these issues.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes 22 features that offer comprehensive details about flights:

1. **Day of Month** and **Day of Week**
2. **Flight Details:** Carrier Code, Tail Number, and Flight Number
3. **Airport Information:** Origin and Destination Airports
4. **Timing Details:** Departure and Arrival Times
5. **Indicators:** Delay, Cancellation, and Diverted Flight Status
6. **Other Features:** Distance between airports
